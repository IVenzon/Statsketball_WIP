# Statsketball: A simple NBA fan site (WIP)

## This project utilizes python, flask, and bootstrap to create an easy way for NBA fans to share and compare their favorite players.

### Note: In order to run this project, you will need to run the following commands in your terminal:

`pipenv install PyMySQL flask`

`pipenv install flask flask-Bcrypt`

`pipenv install numpy`

`pipenv install requests`

`pipenv install nba_api`

# NOTE: IF THE README STILL CONTAINS THIS LINE, THIS MEANS THAT THE PROJECT IS STILL IN IT'S VERY EARLY STAGES. FEATURES ARE CURRENTLY MISSING AND WILL BE ADDED IN OVER TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE!
